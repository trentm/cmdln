High Priority
=============

- issue 3
- announce a release on python-announce
- cmdln 1.1.3 with recent fixes
- new top-level option handling (isn't most or all of this done?):
    - hint at other features in getting started
    - write a reference doc:
        - pilfer from docs/diffs_with_cmd.txt and probably drop that doc
    - release
    - update thirtyboxes.py to use this new option handler
    - clear out the other issues here 
    - test suite



Prioritize These
================

- TODO: possible quick hack to have ${command_list} display sub commands in
  the order in which they are defined? Also provide a sort_command_list()
  hook (or some name like that).
- improve 'django-admin.py' script
- TODO: Implement cmdtest -> doctest for script running at the shell
  Maybe punt on Windows (at least for the interactive bits). I *think* I have
  it basically going, but it is dog-slow on Windows.
    - can it be done without expect?
- TODO: Add an option to special case '?' and '!' (perhaps just while
  cmdlooping) to allow "!ls" or "?subcommand". I.e. no space required.
- TODO: document self.cmdqueue (for one it is now a queue of argv's rather
  than a queue of lines). It is used in some code I've seen out there to
  preload the Cmd instance with some commands.
- TODO: document Cmdln.helpindent
- TODO: document how to add --version option to top-level (via .version
  attrib)
- RFE: configurable options:
    - saved readline history (with a given config file -- reasonable default)
      and using readline.{read|write}_history(line)
- RFE: Can the complete stuff be made to work with standard option handling.
  How about automatically generating Bash (or other shell) completion code
  (see the svn stuff) from class definitions.
- RFE: Does it make sense to borrow line2argv/argv2line from anywhere, e.g.
  subprocess module?
- RFE: do I want to propose this for Python core? As an extension to cmd.py?
- RFE: Handling completion with 'editline'
- svx RFE: have equiv of "px changes -d" for "svx log" or something



Medium Priority
===============

- Fix option formatting to NOT reflow option help. See how --revision
  argument help is being screwed up in svn.py: "examples/svn.py help up".


Low Priority
============

- RFE: format option output like 'svn'
- RFE: format option output like my 'grep' on Windows (i.e. aligning short
  and long options):
        ...
        Miscellaneous:
          -s, --no-messages         suppress error messages
          -v, --invert-match        select non-matching lines
          -V, --version             print version information and exit
              --help                display this help and exit
              --mmap                use memory-mapped input if possible

        Output control:
          -m, --max-count=NUM       stop after NUM matches
          -b, --byte-offset         print the byte offset with output lines
          -n, --line-number         print line number with output lines
        ...

- RFE: Add dispatcher to recognize partial command names without ambiguity.
  Do this as a subclass to (1) show how to do it and (2) to be useful.
- RFE: an OptionParser option handler for std command-line way to control
  logging streams
